## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The Purpose of the analysis is to identify relationships and trends between certain aspects of the given data. 
Being able to analyze data through different filters and lenses allows for a deeper understanding of the the data and allows for new conclusions that can be acted upon.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the data, it seems that the theatre campaigns are more likely to be successful in achieving their goals when created near the summertime as the data shows a large increase in the months of May, June, and July. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This may make sense given that larger goals may tend to be harder to reach than smalled ones

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
We can conclude that
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
